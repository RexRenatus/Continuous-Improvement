# g-2025-09-001 — MVP repository structure

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen)

## Context
Establish a minimal but visual structure that orients visitors on first read and enables monthly execution.

Scope:
- Journal folders and conventions
- Visual root README
- Monthly Goals overview and September index

Success criteria:
- New visitors understand the Ultimate Goal in under 10 seconds
- September has an actionable goals index and at least two concrete subgoals

## Plan
- [ ] Confirm Journal_Entries layout and README
- [ ] Confirm Goals/README monthly visuals present
- [ ] Link September index from root README
- [ ] Mark status active when work starts

## Progress

- 2025-09-28: Added visual root README and monthly goals overview → [README.md](../../README.md), [Goals/README.md](../../Goals/README.md)
- 2025-09-28: Created September goals index → [index.md](index.md)
